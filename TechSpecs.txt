Technical Specifications
1. Introduction
1.1 Executive Summary
1.1.1 Brief Overview Of The Project
This project implements a comprehensive REST API backend application using Rust's Actix Web framework with advanced JWT-based authentication and functional programming capabilities. The system leverages itertools for extra iterator adaptors, functions and macros to create efficient, composable data processing pipelines while maintaining enterprise-grade security through PostgreSQL's Row-Level Security (RLS) feature for per-user data access control.

1.1.2 Core Business Problem Being Solved
The system addresses the critical need for secure, scalable backend infrastructure that combines high-performance functional programming patterns with granular permission management. Traditional REST APIs often struggle with complex authorization scenarios where users should only access specific data rows based on their roles and permissions. This solution implements Row-Level Security to allow database administrators to define policies that control how specific rows of data display and operate for one or more user roles, acting as an additional filter applied before query criteria.

1.1.3 Key Stakeholders And Users

Backend Developers	Functional programming patterns, API performance	Full system access
Database Administrators	Row-level security policies, data integrity	Database management
Frontend Teams	Secure API endpoints, consistent data access	API consumer
Security Teams	Authentication mechanisms, authorization policies	Security oversight
1.1.4 Expected Business Impact And Value Proposition
The solution delivers significant value through:

Enhanced Security: Multiple users can access the same database but only access and edit a subset of rows based on user role and authorization context
Performance Optimization: Functional programming style using functions as values, passing them in arguments and returning them from other functions with extra iterator adaptors for efficient data processing
Scalability: Actix-web framework for building scalable and blazingly-fast web applications
Developer Productivity: Libraries that enhance code expressiveness and maintainability through composable iterators for functional-style operations
1.2 System Overview

3.5 Databases & Storage
3.5.1 Primary Database System
Database	Version	Purpose	Key Features
PostgreSQL	16+	Primary data store	Row security policies that restrict, on a per-user basis, which rows can be returned by normal queries. This feature is also known as Row-Level Security
Postgresql Selection Rationale
PostgreSQL provides essential features for the security-focused architecture:

Row-Level Security: PostgreSQL security feature that allows database administrators to define policies to control how specific rows of data display and operate for one or more user roles
Policy Management: Policies are created using the CREATE POLICY command, altered using the ALTER POLICY command, and dropped using the DROP POLICY command
Multi-Tenant Support: When properly implemented, RLS allows multiple users to access the same database, but only access and edit a subset of its rows based on the user's role and authorization context
3.5.2 Row-level Security Implementation
| RLS Feature | Implementation | Security Benefit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Policy Creation | CREATE POLICY command to define new row-level security policies for each table. Each policy grants permission to specific database operations | Granular access control |
| Table Security | ALTER TABLE … ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY to enable row-level security on the table | Database-level enforcement |
| Session Variables | SET rls.org_id for tenant isolation using current_setting | Dynamic policy enforcement |

3.5.3 Data Persistence Strategy
| Data Type | Storage Approach | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| User Authentication | PostgreSQL tables with RLS | RLS is a Postgres primitive and can provide "defense in depth" to protect your data from malicious actors |
| Session Data | Database-backed sessions | Persistent session management with token revocation |
| Application State | Immutable data structures | Functional programming compatibility |
| Audit Logs | Append-only tables | Compliance and security monitoring |

3.5.4 Performance Considerations
| Performance Aspect | Implementation | Optimization Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| RLS Query Performance | Queries that scan every row in a table - like many select operations, including those using limit, offset, and ordering | Add indexes on any columns used within the Policies |
| Connection Pooling | Diesel connection management | Efficient database connection reuse |
| Query Optimization | Type-safe query building | Compile-time query validation |

Functional Pipeline Stages:

Iterator Construction: Construct an iterable by transitioning from a data source to an iterator, then execute a processing pipeline by applying as many iterator adapters as necessary
Validation Pipeline: Function pipelines apply multiple functions in a sequence to arrive at the final result. Each function takes the result of the previous function as its input
Transformation Chain: Function pipelines compose functions by chaining them together. Each function takes the output of the previous function as its input, allowing us to transform data in complex ways by combining simple functions
Response Formatting: Composable response transformers for consistent API output

5. System Architecture
5.1 High-level Architecture
5.1.1 System Overview
The system implements a powerful, pragmatic, and extremely fast web framework architecture using Rust's Actix Web framework with comprehensive functional programming capabilities and enterprise-grade security through PostgreSQL's Row-Level Security. The architecture follows a layered, security-first approach that combines functional programming and systems programming in Rust to address critical challenges in modern software development, with zero-cost abstractions meaning functional style doesn't sacrifice performance.

The architectural style emphasizes defense in depth security through database-level enforcement, where RLS is a Postgres primitive and can provide "defense in depth" to protect your data from malicious actors. The system leverages asynchronous execution by default to handle many requests concurrently, making it well-suited for high-throughput applications requiring responsive performance under load.

Key architectural principles include:

Functional Composition: Extra iterator adaptors, functions and macros enable composable data processing pipelines with lazy evaluation
Type Safety: Diesel detects most database interaction errors at compile time and is able to produce very efficient code in most cases
Security by Design: When properly implemented, RLS allows multiple users to access the same database, but only access and edit a subset of its rows based on the user's role and authorization context
Zero-Cost Abstractions: Rust's ownership system ensures memory safety without runtime overhead while supporting functional programming patterns
5.1.2 Core Components Table
Component Name	Primary Responsibility	Key Dependencies	Integration Points	Critical Considerations
Authentication Engine	JWT token management and user session handling	jsonwebtoken, argon2	Actix Web middleware, PostgreSQL	Token expiry management, cryptographic algorithm support
Row-Level Security Manager	Database-level access control policy enforcement	PostgreSQL RLS, Diesel ORM	Authentication context, database queries	RLS policies are evaluated for every single row during query execution
Functional Processing Engine	Iterator-based data transformation pipelines	itertools, rayon	API request/response cycle	Iterators are lazy, meaning they have no effect until you call methods that consume the iterator
Database Abstraction Layer	Type-safe database operations and migrations	Diesel ORM, PostgreSQL	RLS policies, connection pooling	Diesel enables you to write reusable code and think in terms of your problem domain and not SQL
5.1.3 Data Flow Description
The primary data flow follows a request-response cycle with multiple security and processing layers. Incoming HTTP requests are processed through Actix Web's routing system, where JWT tokens are validated and user context is extracted. The authentication middleware sets PostgreSQL session variables that enable dynamic policy enforcement during database operations.

Data transformation occurs through functional programming pipelines that leverage items that depend on allocations (like chunk_by, kmerge, join and many more) for complex processing operations. The system maintains immutable state throughout the processing pipeline, ensuring thread safety and predictable behavior.

Database queries are automatically filtered through RLS policies, where policies created for select and delete statements effectively append to the where clause of the query to ensure the correct data is returned. This provides transparent data isolation without requiring application-level filtering logic.

Response transformation applies functional combinators to format API responses consistently, with error handling implemented through monadic patterns using Rust's Result<T, E> type for composable error propagation.

5.1.4 External Integration Points
System Name	Integration Type	Data Exchange Pattern	Protocol/Format	SLA Requirements
PostgreSQL Database	Direct Connection	Connection pooling with session state	PostgreSQL wire protocol	< 20ms query response time
JWT Token Validation	Library Integration	Synchronous validation	JWT functions like auth.uid() and auth.jwt() with initPlan optimization for per-statement caching	< 10ms token validation
Monitoring Systems	HTTP Endpoints	Metrics collection	JSON over HTTP	99.9% availability
Log Aggregation	Structured Logging	Asynchronous log streaming	JSON log format	Real-time log processing
5.2 Component Details
5.2.1 Authentication Engine
Purpose and Responsibilities:
The Authentication Engine provides comprehensive JWT-based authentication with support for multiple cryptographic signing algorithms (HS256, HS384, HS512, EdDSA, ES256) and allows database administrators to define policies to control how specific rows of data display and operate for one or more user roles. It manages the complete authentication lifecycle including user registration, login, token generation, validation, and refresh mechanisms.

Technologies and Frameworks:

jsonwebtoken crate: Core JWT implementation with multi-algorithm support
argon2: Secure password hashing with configurable work factors
actix-web middleware: Request/response interception for token validation
PostgreSQL sessions: User context storage for RLS policy enforcement
Key Interfaces and APIs:

POST /auth/register: User account creation with email validation
POST /auth/login: Credential authentication and token generation
POST /auth/refresh: Token renewal for active sessions
DELETE /auth/logout: Session termination and token revocation
Data Persistence Requirements:
User credentials and session data are stored in PostgreSQL with RLS policies applied. Password hashes use argon2 with salt generation, and session tokens are tracked for revocation capabilities.

Scaling Considerations:
The stateless JWT approach enables horizontal scaling, with session state maintained in the database for revocation support. Connection pooling manages database access efficiently across multiple application instances.

5.2.2 Row-level Security Manager
Purpose and Responsibilities:
The RLS Manager enforces database-level security policies that are applied before the query criteria or other filtering, and the data is narrowed or rejected according to your security policy. It manages policy lifecycle, session variable setting, and dynamic policy enforcement based on user context.

Technologies and Frameworks:

PostgreSQL RLS: Native database security feature
Diesel migrations: Schema and policy management
Session variables: Dynamic context setting using current_setting()
Policy evaluation: Automatic row filtering during query execution
Key Interfaces and APIs:

Policy creation and management through Diesel migrations
Session variable setting: SET rls.user_id, SET rls.org_id
Automatic policy enforcement during database operations
Policy bypass for administrative operations
Data Persistence Requirements:
RLS policies are stored as database metadata and applied automatically during query execution. Performance impact is important to keep in mind, especially for queries that scan every row in a table - like many select operations, including those using limit, offset, and ordering.

Scaling Considerations:
Policy evaluation occurs at the database level, requiring careful index optimization on policy filter columns. Make sure you've added indexes on any columns used within the Policies to maintain query performance.

5.2.3 Functional Processing Engine
Purpose and Responsibilities:
The Functional Processing Engine implements extra iterator adaptors, functions and macros for efficient data processing pipelines. It provides composable validation, transformation, and response formatting capabilities using functional programming patterns.

Technologies and Frameworks:

itertools crate: This version of itertools requires Rust 1.63.0 or later
rayon: Parallel processing for performance-critical operations
Rust iterators: Lazy evaluation and zero-cost abstractions
Functional combinators: Composable data transformation functions
Key Interfaces and APIs:

Iterator chain construction and composition
Validation pipeline creation and execution
Response transformation and formatting
Parallel processing coordination
Data Persistence Requirements:
The engine operates on immutable data structures with structural sharing for memory efficiency. Processing state is maintained functionally without side effects.

Scaling Considerations:
Iterators are lazy, meaning they have no effect until you call methods that consume the iterator, enabling efficient memory usage. Parallel processing capabilities scale with available CPU cores.

5.2.4 Database Abstraction Layer
Purpose and Responsibilities:
The Database Abstraction Layer provides type-safe database operations through Diesel, which is designed to be abstracted over and enables you to write reusable code and think in terms of your problem domain and not SQL. It manages database connections, migrations, and query composition.

Technologies and Frameworks:

Diesel ORM: Object Relational Mapper and query builder that detects most database interaction errors at compile time
PostgreSQL: Primary database with RLS support
Connection pooling: Efficient database connection management
Migration system: Schema versioning and evolution
Key Interfaces and APIs:

Type-safe query building and execution
Database migration management
Connection pool configuration
Transaction management and rollback
Data Persistence Requirements:
All data persistence occurs through Diesel's type-safe interface with automatic RLS policy application. On backends that support the RETURNING clause (such as PostgreSQL and SQLite), we can get data back from our insert as well.

Scaling Considerations:
Connection pooling manages database access across multiple application instances. Query optimization and indexing strategies are critical for RLS policy performance.

5.3 Technical Decisions
5.3.1 Architecture Style Decisions
The system adopts a layered architecture with functional programming patterns rather than traditional object-oriented approaches. This decision is justified by recent academic research validating that Rust is fundamentally more functional than many realize, with 66.67% of dominant language features being functional.

Tradeoffs Analysis:

6. System Components Design
6.1 User Authentication And Role Management Components
6.1.1 Jwt Authentication Service
Component Architecture:
The JWT Authentication Service provides comprehensive token-based authentication with multiple cryptographic signing algorithms (HS256, HS384, HS512, EdDSA, ES256) support. The service integrates with the functional programming infrastructure through composable validation pipelines and immutable state management.

Core Responsibilities:

Token generation and validation with configurable expiry policies
User credential verification using argon2 password hashing
Session management with refresh token capabilities
Integration with PostgreSQL session variables for RLS context setting

Policy Management Framework:

Policy Types

Yes

No

Load Table Policies

Execute Query Normally

Evaluate Policy Conditions

Apply Row Filtering

Return Filtered Results

SELECT Policies - USING clause

INSERT Policies - WITH CHECK clause

UPDATE Policies - USING + WITH CHECK

DELETE Policies - USING clause

Session Variable Management:
The system implements dynamic policy enforcement using PostgreSQL session variables:

Variable	Purpose	Usage Pattern	Example
`rls.user_id`	User identification	`current_setting('rls.user_id')`	User-specific data filtering
`rls.org_id`	Tenant isolation	`current_setting('rls.org_id')::uuid`	Multi-tenant data separation
`rls.role`	Role-based access	`current_setting('rls.role')`	Permission-based filtering
Performance Considerations:
RLS policies are evaluated for every single row during query execution, especially impacting queries that scan every row in a table - like many select operations, including those using limit, offset, and ordering. Indexes should be added on any columns used within the Policies.

6.1.3 User Role And Permission Management
Component Design:
The role management system implements hierarchical permission structures with database-level enforcement through RLS policies. The system supports multiple roles per user and dynamic role assignment.

Role Hierarchy Structure:

Role Level	Permissions	RLS Policy Impact	Functional Integration
Super Admin	Bypass RLS, full system access	`BYPASSRLS` attribute	Administrative function pipelines
Organization Admin	Org-wide data access	`org_id` based policies	Org-scoped validation chains
Team Lead	Team-specific data access	`team_id` + `org_id` policies	Team-filtered iterators
User	Personal data access only	`user_id` based policies	User-scoped transformations

This comprehensive system components design integrates all the functional programming capabilities you've implemented with robust authentication, RLS-based authorization, and high-performance database operations. The architecture ensures that multiple users can access the same database but only access and edit a subset of its rows based on the user's role and authorization context, with RLS providing "defense in depth" protection while leveraging your functional programming infrastructure for efficient, composable data processing pipelines.

6.1 Core Services Architecture
6.1.1 Architecture Applicability Assessment
Core Services Architecture is not applicable for this system as it is designed as a single deployable/executable component that uses a single database, with all application subdomains contained within the component and all operations being local. The system implements a monolithic architecture pattern rather than a distributed services architecture.

The Rust Actix Web REST API with functional programming infrastructure and PostgreSQL Row-Level Security represents a well-structured monolithic application that does not require service decomposition or distributed architecture patterns. Actix Web is a powerful, pragmatic, and extremely fast web framework for Rust that supports building scalable applications within a single deployment unit.

6.1.2 Monolithic Architecture Justification
6.1.2.1 Single Application Design Rationale
The system architecture follows a monolithic pattern for several strategic reasons:

Justification Factor	Rationale	System Benefit
**Functional Cohesion**	All functional programming components work together as integrated pipelines	Seamless iterator chain composition and validation
**Database Integration**	PostgreSQL RLS requires tight coupling with application context	Efficient session variable management and policy enforcement
**Performance Optimization**	Actix consistently ranks among the fastest web frameworks, leveraging asynchronous execution by default to handle many requests concurrently	Optimal performance without network overhead
**Development Simplicity**	The application follows the Onion Architecture pattern that organizes the codebase into multiple layers, where each layer depends only on the layers inside of it, creating separation of concerns for maintainable and scalable codebase	Reduced complexity and faster development cycles
6.1.2.2 Modular Monolithic Structure
The system implements a modular monolithic architecture that provides the benefits of modularity while maintaining deployment simplicity:

The monolithic architecture provides an optimal foundation for the current system requirements while maintaining flexibility for future evolution based on actual usage patterns and scaling needs. Despite their popularity in recent years, monolithic applications are still a good choice for applications with small teams and little complexity, though once it becomes too complex, you can consider refactoring it into microservices or a distributed application.

6.2 Database Design
6.2.1 Schema Design
6.2.1.1 Entity Relationships
The database design implements a comprehensive multi-tenant architecture using PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) that allows database administrators to define policies to control how specific rows of data display and operate for one or more user roles. The schema supports the functional programming infrastructure with JWT-based authentication and role-based permissions at the row level.
